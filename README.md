### Flower Classification Model (End to End)
[Flower Classification](https://github.com/ArkZ10/Plant-Classification)

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify flowers into different categories. I experimented with six different models to compare their performance. The best results were achieved using transfer learning with **InceptionV3** as the pre-trained model and LeakyReLU as the activation function, which provided the highest accuracy. After identifying this optimal model, I deployed it using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for integration into a mobile app. This deployment allows real-time flower classification on mobile devices, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in mobile development.

### NLP Model Using MLOps (End to End)
[Fake New Detection](https://github.com/ArkZ10/Fake-News-Detection)

This project addresses the challenge of fake news detection, a critical issue in today's digital era. Fake news can significantly impact public perception, democratic processes, and social stability. Developing machine learning models to classify news articles as real or fake can aid in combating the spread of misinformation. The model achieved: Accuracy: 85.37%, AUC: 91.64%, Identified 12 false positives and 12 false negatives, indicating areas for improvement to reduce prediction errors. The fake news detection model is deployed on the Lintasarta Cloudeka Server, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering free deployment services.

### LSTM Model for Weather Forecasting
[Weather Forecasting](https://github.com/ArkZ10/Weather-Prediction-LSTM)

In this project, I developed a time series forecasting model to predict maximum temperatures in London using historical weather data. The dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values and was visualized to identify temporal patterns in maximum temperatures. The model architecture combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, trained with Huber loss and SGD optimizer, evaluating performance using MAE and Loss metrics. The CNN layer facilitated feature extraction, while LSTM captured temporal dependencies, enabling accurate temperature forecasts. This project underscores the significance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation in time series forecasting, demonstrating practical applications in weather prediction and related domains.

## Projects
### DishDash: Smart Meal Planner App
[Project Link]()

DISHDASH, an innovative application of meal planning for students response to the challenges faced by the majority of people in Indonesia, especially by college students, including confusion over meal choices, unhealthy eating habits, irregular eating patterns and budget constraints. This study presents, a novel solution in the form of a restaurant menu recommendation appüçΩ. The app aims to promote healthy eating habitsüí°assist users in making nutritious choices‚è≥ within their budgetary constraintsüí∏

### Flower Classification Model (End to End)
[Project Link]()

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify flowers into different categories. I experimented with six different models to compare their performance. The best results were achieved using transfer learning with **InceptionV3** as the pre-trained model and LeakyReLU as the activation function, which provided the highest accuracy. After identifying this optimal model, I deployed it using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for integration into a mobile app. This deployment allows real-time flower classification on mobile devices, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in mobile development.
